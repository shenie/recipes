-----------

* 1 cup mashed bananas
* 1 cup sour cream
* 1/4 cup margarine
* 1 cup white sugar

2. Combine banana and sour cream. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time. 
4. Stir in the vanilla and banana mixture.
5. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Then stir into the banana mixture.
6. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan or pans.
